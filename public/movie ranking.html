 <h2>My top 3 movies!</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>Wicked</h3>
 <p>The music is incredible and the story is so tragic. Are some people orced into wickedness?</p>

 <h3>The Barbie Movie</h3>
 <p>The deep contemplating of death and finding our place in the world brings me tears. It is hilarious yet also incredibly serious.</p>

 <h3>A Star is Born</h3>
 <p>The tragic story of depression and suicide. There are so many years and seasons of my life where I deeply relate to this.</p>
